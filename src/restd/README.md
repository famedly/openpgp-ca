# Experimental REST API for OpenPGP CA

To use the OpenPGP CA as a REST service, the CA first needs to be initialized
once (to create the CA key):

```
$ openpgp-ca -d example.oca ca init example.org
```

Then the REST daemon can be started:

```
$ openpgp-ca-restd -d example.oca run

## Previewing an OpenPGP certificate (key) addition or update

When a user uploads an OpenPGP certificate (key), our suggested workflow is to
give the user feedback on aspects of that key before asking them if
they want to persist the new data to OpenPGP CA.

It is good to show human readable information about certificate additions
and updates  for the user to review. In particular because:

- OpenPGP certificates are typically not in a human-readable form, so it's
  useful to confirm that the user has actually uploaded the right key
- This REST-service potentially normalizes certificates,
  some data may be removed (e.g. some user_ids).
- In the case of an update to an existing certificate, information from
  both variants of the certificate will be merged.

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request GET --data @user.json  http://localhost:8000/certs/check
```

The data-file `user.json` contains data in the form:

```
{"email": ["alice@example.org"],
 "name": "Alice Adams",
 "revocations": [],
 "cert": "-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

xsFNBF9orW8BEAC9RievEe67QyvqV7XGnGVV2VwMGuoJFtER8xwU0RCSqKMnu6L+
un0wri829zQm/trLebHDD70Dvwe6Wl5gwXJtbKTETMg3KuJ51DAZvo4W0JUkEvwC
[..]
iIJw33bSlyssaXTnnfGR5KySs91HCl8PlZHJBz4D6+Tae27cA14rcrgRewO8YyBZ
=vus6
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----"}
```

The output of this call is JSON-formatted information about the certificate
(or an error, if the certificate is not acceptable to our system).

This JSON data should be shown to the user, asking them if they want to
persist the certificate as shown. If they confirm, proceed to the next step to
persist the certificate.

## Persisting OpenPGP certificates

After previewing a certificate addition or update, and getting confirmation
for this data from the user, the data can be persisted to the OpenPGP CA
database via a POST request:

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data @user.json  http://localhost:8000/users/new
```

(The format and content of the output of this call is exactly the same as
above for `/certs/check` - except that there may be additional errors in this
call, if persisting to the database fails)


## Revoking a certificate

When a user wants to stop using a certificate, normal procedure is to apply a
"revocation". The revocation marks the certificate as invalid (and can
contain additional information about the reason for revocation).

For the purpose of this API, this operation is a regular "update" to
the certificate.

This update (on the API level) has - in some sense - the semantics
of a "delete" operation, on the logical OpenPGP level: The user's certificate
was marked as usable before the revocation - after the operation it is
marked as not usable.

After revocation, it is good practice to leave this (now invalidated) key
accessible on WKD (ideally indefinitely):
This is how third parties will learn of the key's revocation.


## Listing all OpenPGP certificates for a user

A user is identified by their email, in this service.
To get a list of all OpenPGP certificates for a user, call:

```
curl --request GET http://localhost:8000/certs/list/alice@example.org
```

Among other information, the returned data contains fingerprint strings for
each certificate. These fingerprint strings are used as parameters for the
following operations.


## Marking a certificate as "deactivated"

When a user leaves the organization (such as FSFE), this has subtle
implications for their OpenPGP certificate:

First of all, it probably doesn't mean that the key should be revoked:
A certificate can be associated with various email addresses (such
associations are represented by a number of user_ids).
The user may keep using this key in other contexts, associated with
other email addresses.

When a user leaves FSFE, it makes sense that FSFE stops to certify the
user_id at FSFE, such as `alice@fsfe.org` (after all, this email address does
not exist anymore).

This is what we mean by "deactivation":
While a user is an FSFE member, the FSFE OpenPGP CA will certify their
user_id `alice@fsfe.org`. After the user has left FSFE, this certification
will not be renewed. FSFE stops to certify that the OpenPGP certificate is
associated with the email address `alice@fsfe.org`

However, it is also good practice to keep this key published on the WKD,
in this case. 

This "deactivate" operation can be performed like this:

```
curl --request POST http://localhost:8000/certs/deactivate/<fingerprint>
```

## De-listing a certificate

It is possible that a certificate should actually not be listed on the WKD any
more. However, this is expected to be a rare requirement.
When this operation is appropriate, it can be performed as follows:
 
```
curl --request DELETE http://localhost:8000/certs/<fingerprint>
```
